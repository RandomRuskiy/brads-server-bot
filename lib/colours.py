'''
    Dictionary varibles that can be imported for ease of use in embeds etc.

    To import:
        "from lib.colours import BasicColours (or) RoleColours"

        When setting a colour in an embed, where color = *, you can do BasicColours/RoleColours["colour"] instead of manually setting the hex value.

        Basic Colours are just basic solid colours like its said in the name

        Role Colours are the same colours as the colour roles in the discord which can help you select a colour according to that or something
